# FBFI

FBFI (Fault-tolerance Bottleneck driven Fault Injection) is a fault injection testing approach to the effective and efficient discovery and validation of redundant components deployed in the system under test. It uses the concept of fault-tolerance bottleneck to repeatedly generate fault injection configurations, and does not particularly rely on the availabliity of systemâ€™s complete business structure.
